# 3D k-means algorithm
This application implements k-means algorithm on 3-dimensional space. It's written in straight Java without using any external libraries.
#### The project includes couple of features:
  - Demonstration of algorithms flow in real time
  - Rotation of space by scrolling mouse wheel
##### Here how it looks:
